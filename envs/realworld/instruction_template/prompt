You are expanding a natural language action template dataset in JSON format.

Each entry has two sections:
- "seen": common or frequently used expressions (30 variations)
- "unseen": rarer, creative, or slightly different expressions (20 variations)

Each section contains two lists:
- "verb": variations of the same action
- "state": variations of the same condition or duration

Your task:
Given one example, generate a total of 50 paraphrases (30 seen + 20 unseen) 
that express the same meaning naturally and fluently in English.

Example input:
{
    "verb": ["stir an egg"],
    "state": ["until fluffy"]
}

Expected output:
{
    "seen": {
        "verb": [
            "stir an egg",
            "beat an egg",
            "whisk an egg",
            "mix the egg well",
            "blend the egg evenly",
            ...
            (total 30)
        ],
        "state": [
            "until fluffy",
            "until smooth",
            "for about 2 minutes",
            "until the texture is consistent",
            ...
            (total 30)
        ]
    },
    "unseen": {
        "verb": [
            "give the egg a whirl",
            "work the egg into a mixture",
            "turn the egg over and over",
            "spin the egg around",
            ...
            (total 20)
        ],
        "state": [
            "until it looks aerated",
            "for a short spell",
            "until it's just right",
            "until well incorporated",
            ...
            (total 20)
        ]
    }
}

Rules:
1. Always output valid JSON (no comments, no trailing commas).
2. “seen” must have exactly 30 unique expressions.
3. “unseen” must have exactly 20 unique expressions.
4. All expressions must mean the same thing, no semantic drift.
5. Keep natural and fluent phrasing — human, not robotic.
6. Avoid numbering, quotes inside strings, or explanations.
7. English only.
8. Maintain diversity: mix short and long phrases, simple and descriptive ones.

Now, generate the JSON for the following action and condition:

{
    "verb": ["shake a water glass"],
    "state": ["until the liquid mixes well"]
}
